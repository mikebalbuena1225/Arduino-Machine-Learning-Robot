# Arduino-Multi_Sensor-Robot
The goal is a machine learning robot using multiple arduinos and sensors for feedback.


The physical components that will be used are:
arduino nano and uno

----------------on arduino nano
2 ir sensors
temp and humudity sensor
microphone
vibration sensor
tilt sensor
photoresistor
captive touch sensor
rgb LED
-----------------on arduino uno
2 continuous servos for wheels
servo for hcs0r4 ultrasonic sensor
servo for steering
ultrasonic sensor pointing towards the back
buzzer
laser module
a fewrgb LEDs


First .ino is to test the sensors on the Arduino nano and to test the I2C bus communication
